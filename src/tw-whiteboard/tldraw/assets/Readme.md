# tldraw assets

## Changes

### `src/tw-whiteboard/tldraw/assets/tiddlywiki.files`

This is generated by listing content of `packages/assets/imports.js` or `packages/assets/urls.js` of `@tldraw/assets` package, and generated by JS. So all assets are prefixed with `$:/plugins/linonetwo/tw-whiteboard/assets/` so handled by `src/tw-whiteboard/tldraw/assets/formatedAssets.ts` to load from TW tiddlers.

1. `./overwrite/languages.json` is modified to only include selected languages.
1. `translations` are also clean down to only have 2 languages.
1. and we add some l10n by using suffix in `tiddlywiki.files`

### `formatedAssets.ts`

This is also generated, but add additional import of `src/tw-whiteboard/tldraw/assets/customAssets.ts`.
