# Typescript plugin template for TiddlyWiki5

This template will help you automatically package zipped multiple-file plugin for nodejs wiki, and single file JSON plugin for HTML wiki.

You can also try [Modern.TiddlyDev](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/Modern.TiddlyDev).

## What need to change after apply the template

### Basic

1. update `title`, `author` and `description` in the [src/plugin.info](src/plugin.info), update `url` field in the [package.json](package.json).
2. write your plugin code in the [src/](src/) directory, use `index.ts` as your ts code's entry point.
3. you can use other file name or path, just update the "tsFiles" field in the package.json
4. write `.js.meta` file in the `src` folder for each ts file. It has to be in `src` because in compiled `dist` folder, ts file will become `js` file and being placed in the `src`
5. other tid files just put in the src directory, they will be copy to the plugin automatically.
   1. You can use folder to organize the files, like `src/filters/` to place the filter tiddlers, and that structure will be preserved in the nodejs multiple-file plugin
   2. In the JSON plugin, the structure will strictly follow the tiddler title.
6. update demo site tiddlers in the [demo/](demo/) directory.
7. update this readme.md

## During development

There are some scripts you can run to boost your development.

After `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`:

- `npm run dev-demo` to setup the demo site locally. Re-run this command and refresh browser to see changes to local code and tiddlers.
- `npm run dev` to pack the plugin in the `dist/` directory.

You will need `--legacy-peer-deps` when `npm i` if you are using latest nodejs. This is a bug in npm.

### Add a second ts file

Add new file name (without `.ts`) to `package.json`'s `tsFiles` field. And build script will read it and compile files in it.

## After the plugin is complete

### Publish

Enable github action in your repo (in your github repo - setting - action - general) if it is not allowed, and when you tagging a new version `vx.x.x` in a git commit and push, it will automatically publish to the github release.

### Demo

You will get a Github Pages demo site automatically after publish. If it is 404, you may need to manually enable Github Pages in your github repo:

Settings - Pages (on left side) - Source - choose `gh-pages` branch

## Trouble Shooting

### â–² [WARNING] Import "useFilter" will always be undefined because the file "node_modules/tw-react/dist/plugins/linonetwo/tw-react/index.js" has no exports

See [tw-react](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/tw-react/blob/eb858d33737bfa6cff35f58f27770321080980f6/esbuild.config.mjs#L35-L43)'s esbuild config, you will need to exclude the file from the modification here.
